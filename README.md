# Microcontroller

During the 2020 covid-19 outbreak, the need arose for a detection of the breath rate to
help medical staff with the treatment of covid-19 patients. The goal of this project is to
be able to make the sensor and micro-controller simple and cheap.In order for this to be
effective the sensor needs to non invasive thus not requiring approval from the Health society,
the program should also be able to reliable detect the breath rate and warn hospital staff of
irregular breathing rates.
